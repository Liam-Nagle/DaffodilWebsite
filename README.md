Baking Website for a Client

Creating a Online baking website with Orders and Info about the inhome business for a client. 

Idea is to have a homepage displaying info about the company/person that bakes the cakes along with a basket system for ordering. 

Currently haven't been given any information for the website. This is just me messing around with some design stuff and some ideas.
